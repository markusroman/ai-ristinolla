This repository is a simple tic-tac-toe against a simulated opponent. The game is supposed to be impossible to win.

If you want to play it locally, follow these steps:

- Open a terminal
- Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/markusroman/ai-ristinolla.git`
- Move to the created directory `cd ai-ristinolla`
- Install the packages with `npm install`
- Run the program with `npm start`
  
**This doesn't work, if you don't have node and git installed!**

#### You can also try the game directly in a browser, [HERE](https://ai-ristinolla.netlify.app/)!
